[00:21.02] I got your letter
[00:22.75] I felt so scared to
[00:24.43] Pick up the paper knife and read within
[00:27.82] I read the contents
[00:29.54] I got what you meant
[00:31.40] I know it's hard on you, but don't give in
[00:34.20] Maybe, maybe slow things go fast
[00:41.11] Maybe, maybe it's all in the past
[00:57.61] 
[00:48.02] Oh, oh, if you need me don't let go, oh
[00:52.53] (You know I won't give up on you)
[00:54.99] Oh, oh, if you need me don't let go, oh
[00:59.68] (You know I won't give up on you)
[01:07.67] You know I'll never give up on you
[01:24.67] 
[01:15.55] I phoned the station
[01:17.30] For information
[01:19.13] To try and get the times of trains to York
[01:22.44] And on the platform
[01:24.16] I saw your hatform
[01:25.89] A kind of halo in the crowd, crush talk
[01:28.68] But baby, baby don't run away
[01:35.70] Maybe, maybe it's just today
[01:49.70] 
[01:42.69] Oh, oh if you need me don't let go, oh
[01:47.16] (You know I won't give up on you)
[01:49.44] Oh, oh, if you need me don't let go, oh
[01:54.09] (You know I won't give up on you)
[02:02.59] Don't let go
[02:08.83] You know I won't ever give up on you
[02:26.83] 
[02:16.91] You dropped your suitcase
[02:18.66] I saw your sad face
[02:20.29] And I appreciate the state you're in
[02:23.87] You mustn't worry
[02:25.69] You mustn't hurry
[02:27.14] I know it's hard on you, but don't give in
[02:30.20] Maybe, maybe slow things go fast
[02:36.92] Maybe, maybe it's all in the past
[02:53.42] 
[02:43.89] Oh, oh, if you need me don't let go, oh
[02:48.41] (You know I won't give up on you)
[02:50.82] Oh, oh if you need me don't let go, oh
[02:55.30] (You know I won't give up on you)
[02:57.13] Don't let go
[03:03.13] 
[03:17.75] I will never give up on you, ah
[03:33.25] 
[03:34.90] I'll never give up on you
