Waiting on somebody else to save me
I hurt myself with foolish pride
The weight of the world, I carry
But I avenge thee
I do this, oh
When I let go (go, go, go)
Then I let go (go, go)
And I went back home (go)
I am no longer mad at ya, baby
Such a nice day, come outside
Rich from the attention you paid me
And now I see (I see)
It'll be alright
When I let go
Then I let go (go, go)
And I went back home (go)
